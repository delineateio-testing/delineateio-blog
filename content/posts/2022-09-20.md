## Next: Focus on One Thing

With a lot on your plate, it’s hard to pick one thing to focus on. But that’s exactly what I’m going to ask you to do.

Pick one thing, and give it your focus. Yes, there are a lot of other things you can focus on. Yes, they’re stressing you out and making it hard to focus. But think about it this way: if you allow it all to be in your head all the time, that will always be your mode of being. You’ll always be thinking about everything, stressing out about it all, with a frazzled mind … unless you start shifting.

```golang
package main 

func main() {
    fmt.PrintLn("hello, world!")
}
```

```javaScript
require("dotenv").config
const Bot = require('node-telegram-bot-api');
const {
    INPUT_STATUS: ipstatus,
    INPUT_TOKEN: tgtoken,//Telegram api token
    INPUT_CHAT: chatid,// Telegram Chat ID
    INPUT_IU_TITLE: ititle,// Issue title
    INPUT_IU_NUM: inum,// Issue Number
    INPUT_IU_ACTOR: iactor,// Issue made by
    INPUT_IU_BODY: ibody,// Issue Body
    INPUT_PR_NUM: pnum,// PR Number
    INPUT_PR_STATE: prstate,// PR Opened, reponed or closed
    INPUT_PR_TITLE: ptitle,// PR Title
    INPUT_PR_BODY: pbody,// Body of the PR
    GITHUB_EVENT_NAME: ghevent,// Name of the trigger event
    GITHUB_REPOSITORY: repo,// Repository the trigger was made from
    GITHUB_ACTOR: ghactor,// User who triggered the action
    GITHUB_SHA: sha,// Commit ID
    GITHUB_WORKFLOW: ghwrkflw// Workflow Name
} = process.env;

const bot = new Bot(tgtoken)
```
